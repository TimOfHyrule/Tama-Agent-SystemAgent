// network. Run locally or in CI: `node scripts/check.mjs`.
//
// ── What is worth checking here ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not "is the contract current" -- that needs to reach the Tamarada repo,
// which is private, so it needs a token (see .github/workflows/check.yml).
// What CAN be checked without one is more interesting anyway: whether the
// machinery that USES these files still works on them.
//
// bin/tama refuses paid routes by parsing docs/AGENT_API.md, and bin/memo
// appends by finding a marker in memory/*.md. Both are text-matching a file
// they do not own. If either stops matching, nothing throws -- the guard
// simply refuses nothing, and the memo simply writes nowhere. Those are the
// failures worth a check, because they are the ones that look like success.
//
// bin/mem is checked more thinly on purpose: what it talks to is Tamarada, not
// a file in here, so most of what could go wrong needs a credential and a
// network. What IS checkable is the same shape as the above -- whether its
// documentation still describes the tool.
